## Toy Examples & Emotion Recognition Notebooks

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on machine learning techniques and their application to toy examples and emotion recognition based on facial landmarks.

### Toy Examples

`TP_IntroSupervised_MachineLearning_0part_toy_classification.ipynb` demonstrates how to classify data using different machine learning techniques. The data are 2D points sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and we aim to classify them into 2, 3 or 4 classes.

### Concepts Illustrated

- Data Generation & Plotting
- Linear Regression with Integer Transformation and OneHotEncoding
- Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, GNB, and KNN methods
- Decision Boundaries Analysis
- Comparisons in Computational Time and Test Accuracy

The main takeaway from this notebook is the varying performances of different classification methods depending on the structure and complexity of the data.

### Emotion Recognition Based on Facial Landmarks

`TP_IntroSupervised_MachineLearning_1part_FEI.ipynb` delves into the concept of emotion recognition based on facial landmarks. This notebook uses the FEI dataset to distinguish between neutral and happy emotions.

### Concepts Illustrated

- Facial Landmarks Extraction
- Generalized Procrustes Analysis
- Feature Extraction & Scaling
- LDA and Cross-Validation Performance
- Hyperparameter Tuning using Cross-Validation
- Collinearity and PCA
- Landmark Selection 

From this notebook, we learn about the complexities involved in facial emotion recognition and the benefits of thoughtful feature selection and scaling.
